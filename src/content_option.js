    "Keeping this short and sweet - I currently reside in South Florida, I have been a dev for about 6 years now and have loved every minute of it. Frontend development is 100% my forte, but I am open to Fullstack work as well. Aside from sitting in front of my desk looking at colorful letters and numbers, I also own and sometimes(very rarely now) help out at one of Port Saint Lucie, Florida's most renowned vinyl wrap shops! Oh, and we have 42 animals here at home - notable favorites are the blue tongue skink, african grey and chinchillas.",
